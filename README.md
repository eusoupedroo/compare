# BAIXOPRECO - THE PRICE MARKET COMPARATOR

### About This Project:
Have you noticed how difficult it is to check supermarket prices and promotions? Where is it more worthwhile to buy a certain thing, where would it be cheaper to buy your list of products? There are two tools we have to check current product offers and prices, the market app and the newspapers, have you ever thought if there was a tool where you could insert your product list and it would show you the results of the markets from cheapest to more expensive ?

Well, that's what the platform I'm building does, it queries all your records in the database for the products you entered and then gives you the results objectively and quickly.

The interface is totally friendly and objective, the project is expected to be completed in two weeks, so we will host it for an experimental version and I count on you to inform your experience with the platform.
